Cats were not embalmed with wooden masks or placed in pet cemeteries with tiny mummies of mice.\n4. Toxoplasmosis is not caused by eating raw or rare beef; it's a protozoan disease that can be spread through contaminated cat feces, not food.\n5. Pregnant women and people with a depressed immune system should avoid direct contact with cat litter boxes to minimize the risk of infection.\n\nRegarding cats' diet, while they do need fat for energy, their primary source of nutrition is meat, particularly high-quality animal protein. They can obtain some fat from their prey, but not directly from their own feces or litter box.\n\nAs for why cats bury their feces, it's primarily to cover their trails and avoid detection by predators, as you mentioned in the original question."
